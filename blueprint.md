# Project Blueprint: Product Builder Lecture

## Overview
The **Product Builder Lecture** project is a template for teaching modern web development without the overhead of heavy frameworks. It focuses on the "Baseline" features of the web platform to ensure longevity, performance, and accessibility.

## Project Structure & Features
- **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Components:** Custom Elements (Web Components) for encapsulated UI.
- **Styling:** Advanced CSS features like `@container`, `@layer`, and `:has()`.
- **Environment:** Configured for Google IDX with Nix-based environments.

## Implementation Details
- `index.html`: Main entry point.
- `main.js`: Core logic and Web Component definitions.
- `style.css`: Global styles and design tokens.

## Current Plan
1. **Organize Workspace:** Initialize `README.md` and `blueprint.md` (Completed).
2. **Scaffold Components:** Create basic reusable components (Header, Footer, Product Card).
3. **Apply Design System:** Implement a modern, vibrant aesthetic using OKLCH and subtle textures.
4. **Final Polish:** Ensure mobile responsiveness and accessibility.
